 * IoV2BeatToSyncAdapter — dedicated adapter auto-inserted by the gvrun2 systree
 * on io_v2 bindings whose master side declares signature IoV2Beat and whose
 * slave side declares signature IoV2Sync.
 *
 * It is a specialisation of IoV2BeatAdapter for the case where the downstream
 * slave honours the *sync* contract: every request completes inline with
 * IO_REQ_DONE (never IO_REQ_GRANTED + resp(), never IO_REQ_DENIED + retry()).
 * That lets the adapter be trivial: each write beat is forwarded to the slave
 * inline (single-beat framing — the sync plane knows no bursts) and consumed
 * on the spot; a read burst — which carries no data under the beat protocol —
 * is streamed one beat at a time, each beat read from the sync slave at its
 * own delivery cycle (not pre-read at submit) so no queue of filled beats is
 * ever held. An FSM drives the queue: the beats of a burst are paced by each
 * beat's own bandwidth occupancy (get_duration(), floored at one cycle), so
 * the transfer spreads naturally across the burst window; writes/atomics
 * stream at one per cycle. The burst's head beat is the one exception — when
 * the stream is idle it is issued at submit (the address phase) purely to
 * sample the head latency, and its data rides along to be delivered after
 * that latency. No async/deny bookkeeping.
 *
 * Wire-protocol invariants preserved (identical to the general adapter for the
 * sync case):
 *   - The input port's req callback returns IO_REQ_GRANTED — never IO_REQ_DONE.
 *   - For each READ submission the upstream master receives exactly
 *     ceil(total_size / beat_width) resp() calls in byte order, is_first on the
 *     first, is_last on the last, with size/addr/burst_id/status set per beat.
 *     addr is the per-beat start address (burst_addr + emitted). Read beats are
 *     distinct allocator-backed objects the terminal master copies out of and
 *     frees.
 *   - WRITES are acknowledged once per burst (AXI B-channel semantics, see
 *     io_v2.hpp "Write acknowledgement"). The adapter is the consumer of the
 *     master's allocator-backed write beats: each is forwarded inline and
 *     freed on the spot (parked, for the burst's last beat), and a single
 *     data-less ack — recycling that last beat — is emitted upstream when the
 *     burst completes. Every beat still queues its beat-width worth of SILENT
 *     entries in the same shared FIFO (virtual acks), so the single real ack
 *     drains through the read/write-interleaved 1-entry/cycle stream on
 *     exactly the cycle the last per-beat ack fired before the protocol
 *     change. Atomic opcodes (opcode != WRITE) carry response data and keep
 *     the classic round-trip of the master's own request.
 *   - Read beats are paced by each beat's own bandwidth occupancy: the head
 *     beat lands at the head latency (get_latency()), and every following beat
 *     max(1, get_duration()) cycles after the previous one. A slave with no
 *     duration (e.g. memory_v3) degrades to one beat per cycle. Each beat is
 *     read at the cycle it is delivered (the head beat excepted).
 *
 * Multi-outstanding: a second burst received while one is still streaming is
 * forwarded inline and queued behind the active one.
 *
 * The file is a private header for the component implementation; no model
 * includes it (the framework auto-inserts the component).
