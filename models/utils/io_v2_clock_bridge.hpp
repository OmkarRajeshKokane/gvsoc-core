/*
 * IoV2ClockBridge β€” v2 IO clock-domain bridge auto-inserted by the systree
 * on bindings whose two endpoints resolve to different clock sources.
 *
 * Two modes selected by (k_src_per_dir, k_dst_per_dir):
 *
 *   k_src = k_dst = 0 (DEFAULT, "sync_only"):
 *     Zero modeled latency, but still re-synchronizes each crossing onto
 *     the destination clock edge β€” like a CDC synchronizer sampling on the
 *     next edge. The forward req is forwarded inline (the downstream slave
 *     re-aligns when it enqueues on its own clock); the async resp is
 *     scheduled on the master engine's next edge so the cluster sees it on
 *     a cluster cycle, not on the SoC edge the resp happened to land on.
 *
 *   k_src > 0 or k_dst > 0 (parametric, "cdc_*_beh"):
 *     Models a CDC IP as four cycle-counted stages:
 *
 *       fwd_src (master_clk, k_src cycles) β†’ fwd_dst (slave_clk, k_dst)
 *       out.req β€” downstream slave β€” resp
 *       rev_src (slave_clk, k_src) β†’ rev_dst (master_clk, k_dst) β†’ in.resp
 *
 *     Each stage has its own FIFO of pending transactions ordered by
 *     absolute cycle deadline in its clock engine, and its own
 *     vp::ClockEvent always scheduled to the head's deadline. The slave-
 *     domain events are enqueued directly on the slave engine, so
 *     frequency changes are tracked structurally β€” the engine maps cycles
 *     to wall time, not the bridge.
 *
 *     `depth` caps total in-flight across all four stages. depth=1 is
 *     strictly serial; depth>1 lets FIFO kinds pipeline.
 *
 * Ownership (io_v2 per-burst write-acknowledgement contract, see io_v2.hpp
 * "Write acknowledgement"):
 *
 *   The bridge is a mid-chain FORWARDER: it passes the SAME request object
 *   through in both directions and never copies a payload — the buffer
 *   behind a write beat's data is valid exactly as long as the beat is
 *   unfreed, so beats parked in the stage queues keep their payload alive
 *   by construction, no copy needed. Once the downstream GRANTs a forwarded
 *   write beat the bridge never touches it again: the target consumes and
 *   frees it, and non-last write beats produce no response at all. The
 *   burst's single ack flows back through the rev path as an ordinary
 *   response, relayed 1:1 (the bridge is not the initiator and never frees
 *   it). The one case where the bridge manufactures anything is an inline
 *   DONE on the burst's LAST write beat: the beat was granted to the bridge
 *   by the upstream master, so the bridge still owns it and recycles it in
 *   place as the data-less burst ack, delivered through the rev path so the
 *   ack keeps the CDC delay shape. Reads and atomics keep the classic
 *   round-trip through the rev queues, unchanged.
 *
 *   Because granted-and-consumed write beats never come back, the upstream
 *   accept window (the `depth` gate) must re-open from the FORWARD-path
 *   drain, not only from the response-path drain — see maybe_retry() /
 *   schedule_retry().
 *
 * Python wrappers (io_v2_clock_bridge.py) set sensible defaults per kind:
 *
 *   IoV2ClockBridge       k_src=0 k_dst=0 depth=1   (sync_only default)
 *   IoV2Cdc2PhaseBeh      k_src=1 k_dst=2 depth=1
 *   IoV2CdcFifoGrayBeh    k_src=1 k_dst=2 depth=2
 *   IoV2CdcFifo2PhaseBeh  k_src=3 k_dst=3 depth=2
